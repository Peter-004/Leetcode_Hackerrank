# 🧠 LeetCode & HackerRank Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to coding challenges from **LeetCode** and **HackerRank**, implemented across **multiple programming languages**. It serves as a structured archive of my problem-solving approach, language proficiency, and algorithmic thinking.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Practice and reinforce **core data structures & algorithms**
- Develop fluency across **multiple languages**
- Compare problem-solving patterns between languages
- Maintain a clean, version-controlled record of solutions

This repository prioritizes **clarity, correctness, and reasoning** over brute-force answers.

---

## 🧰 Languages Used
Solutions are organized by language and platform. Current and planned languages include:
- JavaScript
- Python
- Java
- C++
- (More as needed)

---

## 📁 Repository Structure
- Each problem will be saved to a single file, and the link to that challenge will be commented at the top of the code as line 1.
